# E-Commerce Backend
Assignment application for Week 13 - Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for bootcamp

## Task
Creating an application that runs strictly in the backend, using the terminal and the software Insomnia, as well as dependencies such as dotenv, express, mysql2, sequelize, and sqlite3, to run the backend of an e-commerce site.

Once running the application through the command "Node server.js" in the terminal, and then launching Insomnia to view the port the app is listed on, a person can look at the list of products, tags, and categories - both as all of the items under those lists, or at a specific item through searching by ID. A person can also go in and create, update, and delete a product, tag, and/or category.

## Video Link
Since there's no actual web link for this application - once again being just a backend program - I've included a video link example to show how this application works.
